# NppPlugin-ZipFileList
Using the current file in Notepad++ as a source file list, create an archive file using 7-Zip (requires 7-Zip to be installed separately).  Note: The file list needs to be saved before zipping.

Using the finest principles of laziness, I have created this plugin to save me opening a command shell and typing in a 7-Zip command to create an archive.
For my use and testing, the file list is assumed to be relative to the path the file is located in. It should work with absolute paths too.  Not tested a whole lot outside of my own usage requirements.  Feedback welcome.

Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net">NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net<a/> for making the API so accessible in .Net.
