# NppPlugin-ZipFileList
Using the current file in Notepad++ as a source file list, create an archive file using 7-Zip (requires 7-Zip to be installed separately).

Using the finest principles of laziness, I have created this plugin to save me opening a command shell and typing in a 7-Zip command to create an archive.
Testing so far has been minimal, this is an alpha release.

Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net">NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net<a/> for making the API so accessible in .Net.
